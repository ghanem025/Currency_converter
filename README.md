# Currency_converter
Developed a currency converter in Java Using a Currency Converter API and JSON to get the updated rates.

Description:
This is a simple currency converter made in Java using java swing for the front end (used java swing to create the GUI) and regular OOP java for the currency conversion.


here is a picture of the application to get an idea of what it looks like.

the text field is used to enter the amount you want to convert

also there are drop down menus to select different currencies you would like to convert from and to.

 once you selected the two currency you would like to convert, you click the button and it will convert the amount you entered

 (example shown here, you enter the amount then it will convert the first drop down selected (CAD) into the second drop down (USD) as shown in the picture above)
 
 The conversion is made within the java code, however instead of manually inputting the rates, i decided to use a currency conversion API that automatically gives me the latests rates so that this project will always have accurate conversions. 
 
 Fun little project i did since i always find myself trying to figure out different exchange rates since i have family all over the world, now it will be much easier for me and i don't need a browser to do it either.

more features coming soon...
